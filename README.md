# Crafted Treasures

## Handmade Artistry for Every Heart and Home

Crafted Treasures is an online (fictional) boutique offering a curated collection of artisanal products and creations, designed to add a touch of craftsmanship to their customers life. From handcrafted ceramics to eco-friendly textiles, each piece is lovingly made by skilled artisans to bring beauty and joy to your home.

This project (my very first project ever!) showcases a simple yet elegant interface for an online store, created using pure HTML and CSS.
